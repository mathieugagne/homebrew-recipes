Mash out at 170°F (77°C) and sparge. Collect 8 gallons (30 L) of runoff, stir in dextrose and bring to a boil.\n\nAdd hops as indicated in the recipe.\n\nAfter a 90 minute boil, chill wort to 67°F (19°C) and transfer to a fermenter. Pitch two packages of yeast or a yeast starter and aerate well.\n\nFerment at 67°F (19°C) until fermentation activity subsides, then rack to secondary.\n\nAdd first set of dry hops on top of the racked beer and age 7-9 days, then add the second set. Age five more days then bottle or keg.","rank":3,"created_at":"2017-01-29T11:20:37.111-05:00","updated_at":"2018-03-06T06:32:14.176-05:00","view_count":0,"hopville_recipe_id":null,"top_up_water_volume":null,"measurement_system_id":2,"group_id":428,"average_rating":null,"is_private":false,"duration_of_primary":7,"duration_of_secondary":14,"ibu_formula_id":1,"indexed_at":null,"trub_chiller_loss":0.0,"kettle_volume":30.0,"memoized_cost":null,"has_activity":false,"recipe_fermentables":[{"id":4710498,"recipe_fermentable_use_id":1,"recipe_id":404014,"generic_fermentable_id":37,"maltster_id":null,"fermentable_id":null,"amount":5.4,"created_at":"2017-02-22T21:07:35.458-05:00","updated_at":"2017-02-22T21:07:35.458-05:00","amount_id":null,"country_id":null,"color":1,"ppg":37,"fermentable_type_id":6,"name":"2-Row
