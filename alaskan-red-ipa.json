Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, then run off into the kettle. Sparge the grains with 3.9 gallons (14.7 l) and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 l) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, following the hops schedule.\n\nAfter the boil, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 60°F (16°C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 65°F (18°C) for 7 days, then let the temperature rise to 68°F (20°C) and hold for an additional 7 days, then crash the beer to 35°F (2°C). Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes of CO2.","rank":363,"created_at":"2018-09-16T10:29:32.720-04:00","updated_at":"2018-11-11T15:26:59.760-05:00","view_count":0,"hopville_recipe_id":null,"top_up_water_volume":null,"measurement_system_id":2,"group_id":428,"average_rating":null,"is_private":false,"duration_of_primary":7,"duration_of_secondary":null,"ibu_formula_id":1,"indexed_at":null,"trub_chiller_loss":0.0,"kettle_volume":30.0,"memoized_cost":null,"has_activity":true,"recipe_fermentables":[{"id":5845213,"recipe_fermentable_use_id":1,"recipe_id":455213,"generic_fermentable_id":46,"maltster_id":null,"fermentable_id":null,"amount":4.5,"created_at":"2018-09-16T13:00:15.938-04:00","updated_at":"2018-09-16T13:00:15.938-04:00","amount_id":null,"country_id":null,"color":3,"ppg":38,"fermentable_type_id":6,"name":"Maris Otter Pale (UK)","amount_is_metric":true,"unit":"kg"},{"id":5845214,"recipe_fermentable_use_id":1,"recipe_id":455213,"generic_fermentable_id":144,"maltster_id":null,"fermentable_id":null,"amount":0.454,"created_at":"2018-09-16T13:00:15.946-04:00","updated_at":"2018-09-16T13:00:15.946-04:00","amount_id":null,"country_id":null,"color":6,"ppg":38,"fermentable_type_id":8,"name":"Munich (BE)","amount_is_metric":true,"unit":"kg"},{"id":5845216,"recipe_fermentable_use_id":2,"recipe_id":455213,"generic_fermentable_id":109,"maltster_id":null,"fermentable_id":null,"amount":0.23,"created_at":"2018-09-16T13:00:15.960-04:00","updated_at":"2018-09-16T13:00:15.960-04:00","amount_id":null,"country_id":null,"color":120,"ppg":33,"fermentable_type_id":7,"name":"Extra Dark Crystal 120L (UK)","amount_is_metric":true,"unit":"kg"},{"id":5845215,"recipe_fermentable_use_id":2,"recipe_id":455213,"generic_fermentable_id":95,"maltster_id":null,"fermentable_id":null,"amount":0.23,"created_at":"2018-09-16T13:00:15.953-04:00","updated_at":"2018-09-16T13:00:15.953-04:00","amount_id":null,"country_id":null,"color":45,"ppg":34,"fermentable_type_id":7,"name":"Crystal 45L (UK)","amount_is_metric":true,"unit":"kg"},{"id":5845217,"recipe_fermentable_use_id":1,"recipe_id":455213,"generic_fermentable_id":71,"maltster_id":null,"fermentable_id":null,"amount":0.11,"created_at":"2018-09-16T13:00:15.966-04:00","updated_at":"2018-09-16T13:00:15.966-04:00","amount_id":null,"country_id":null,"color":340,"ppg":32,"fermentable_type_id":7,"name":"Carafa I (DE)","amount_is_metric":true,"unit":"kg"}],"recipe_hops":[{"recipe_id":455213,"id":5302433,"hop_id":52195,"hop_use_id":3,"hop_form_id":1,"hop_type_id":null,"alpha":16.8,"beta":null,"amount":18.0,"time":45,"created_at":"2018-09-16T13:00:15.974-04:00","updated_at":"2018-09-16T13:00:15.974-04:00","amount_id":null,"country_id":11,"name":"Summit (US)","amount_is_metric":true},{"recipe_id":455213,"id":5302434,"hop_id":52139,"hop_use_id":3,"hop_form_id":1,"hop_type_id":null,"alpha":7.8,"beta":null,"amount":28.0,"time":20,"created_at":"2018-09-16T13:00:15.982-04:00","updated_at":"2018-09-16T13:00:15.982-04:00","amount_id":null,"country_id":11,"name":"Cascade (US)","amount_is_metric":true},{"recipe_id":455213,"id":5302436,"hop_id":52140,"hop_use_id":3,"hop_form_id":1,"hop_type_id":null,"alpha":8.7,"beta":null,"amount":28.0,"time":5,"created_at":"2018-09-16T13:00:16.002-04:00","updated_at":"2018-09-16T13:00:16.002-04:00","amount_id":null,"country_id":11,"name":"Centennial (US)","amount_is_metric":true},{"recipe_id":455213,"id":5302435,"hop_id":53366,"hop_use_id":3,"hop_form_id":1,"hop_type_id":null,"alpha":12.5,"beta":null,"amount":28.0,"time":5,"created_at":"2018-09-16T13:00:15.990-04:00","updated_at":"2018-09-16T13:00:15.990-04:00","amount_id":null,"country_id":11,"name":"Mosaic™ (US)","amount_is_metric":true}],"recipe_yeasts":[{"recipe_id":455213,"yeast_id":15,"id":1430973,"laboratory_id":2,"amount":null,"attenuation":68.5,"amount_is_weight":false,"add_to_secondary":false,"created_at":"2018-09-16T13:00:16.010-04:00","updated_at":"2018-09-16T13:00:16.010-04:00","product_id":"WLP036","yeast_flocculation_id":null,"yeast_alcohol_tolerance_id":null,"yeast_type_id":1,"yeast_form_id":1,"temperature_min":65.0,"temperature_max":69.0,"name":"Dusseldorf Alt Yeast"}],"recipe_extras":[],"recipe_mash_steps":[]}
